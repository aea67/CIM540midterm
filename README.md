# Air Guitar

Is a game with an interface that looks like a guitar. It aims to imitate learning notes on a guitar by playing them in the sequence that the user must then follow to get it right.

## Code Plan

### Inputs

I will have a start button that the user must click on to start the game.

### Outputs

Once the button is pressed, the output is the strings playing, which look like different line sections of the guitar lighting up

### Pseudocode

Play button
when tune1 = 1 and counter = 0, clicking PLAY:
starts game and counter++

Lines start highlighting in sequence, and stop when finished.
tune1 becomes false and counter = 0

hitting play makes game play sequence again.
